	<p>Why:  Help a company get their message across more successfully, better</p>
	<p>How:    Study coding and website design</p>
	<p>What:  Great websites</p>

	<p>Elevator pitch:  Hi, my name is Leonora.  I want to help companies be more successful by creating great websites for them that are beautiful, easy to use and clear and make them more successful.  I’m doing this by learning all aspects of web coding, including Php, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.</p>

	<h2>Week 2</h2>
	<p>I already submitted my resume and discussed it with you.</p>
	<p>I re-joined LinkedIn and also joined Quora</p>
	<p>I googled Godfrey, and found one social media platform:  LinkedIn.  I had to google the states with his name to get results, because there are quite a few Godfrey Davises.  I googled his name with New York and then with Albuquerque.  I emailed him the results and he told me he was listed under aliases. He said he is careful about what he puts out on social media.</p>
	<p>I’m in the process of designing custom business cards.</p>
	<p>Last one is now complete.</p>
